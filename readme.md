# RUST BASIC Powered By AI

Welcome to the **Rust Basics** repository, a collection of foundational Rust programming topics. This project is designed to help learners get started with Rust by exploring key concepts such as variables, data types, control flow, and more.

## Overview

Rust is a systems programming language that emphasizes performance, safety, and concurrency. This repository will guide you through some of the most important and basic features of the language.

## Topics Covered

Here is an organized list of topics with a brief description for each:

| Topic                    | Description                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Hello World**          | A simple "Hello, World!" program to get started with Rust.                                 |
| **Cargo**                | Learn how to use Cargo, the Rust package manager and build system.                         |
| **Unit Test**            | Writing and running unit tests to ensure code correctness.                                 |
| **Variable**             | Understanding variable declarations, mutability, and scoping.                              |
| **Comment**              | Using comments in Rust code for clarity and documentation.                                 |
| **Data Type**            | Exploring the basic data types available in Rust (e.g., integers, floats, booleans, etc.). |
| **Number**               | Working with numeric types, including integer and floating-point numbers.                  |
| **Numeric Operations**   | Performing basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication.     |
| **Boolean**              | Understanding boolean values and their role in logic and conditions.                       |
| **Comparison Operators** | Using comparison operators (e.g., `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`) to compare values.                 |
| **Boolean Operators**    | Using logical boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine boolean values.                  |
| **Char**                 | Working with characters and understanding the char data type.                              |
| **Array**                | Introduction to arrays in Rust and how to work with them.                                  |
| **Constant**             | Defining and using constants in Rust to store fixed values.                                |
| **Variable Scope**       | Understanding the scope of variables and how they affect code behavior.                    |

## How to Run the Code

To run the examples in this repository:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yogithesymbian/rust_basic.git
   cd rust_basic
   ```

2. Make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install it from [Rust's official site](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).

3. Each topic is separated into a `src` file (e.g., `src/hello_world.rs`, `src/cargo.rs`). You can compile and run the code in any of these files with Cargo:

   ```bash
   cargo run --example hello_world
   ```

   Replace `hello_world` with the name of any example you want to run.
